This code is an implementation of a banking application that allows users to create accounts, log in, send and receive money, and view their transaction history.
 The application stores user data in a file named "user.txt" and uses linked lists to keep track of the transactions made by each user.

The code defines several structs to represent users, transactions sent and received by users, and linked lists to store these transactions. 
It also includes functions to perform various operations such as checking if a user already exists, creating a new user account, logging in to an existing account, sending and receiving money, and viewing transaction history.

The main function of the code sets up a vector of User objects and prompts the user to log in or create a new account. Once logged in, the user can perform various banking operations such as sending and receiving money, and viewing transaction history. 
The code uses threads and sleep functions to simulate a real-world banking application where multiple users may be performing transactions simultaneously.
